SkeletonDesignPanel
================

This is a plug-in for Flash Pro. With the help of it, you can build the 2D skeleton animation in Flash Pro, then export it to the specific format. The SkeletonAnimationFramework https://github.com/DragonBones/SkeletonAnimationFramework can parse the format, and then you can use it in your 2D display engine. 
To modify the plug-in, you should include the SkeletonAnimationFramework to your source code path.
